# Features

This game was created for the purpose of improving my programming skills with reference to the "スイカゲーム" by popIn, Inc.  
This game is for non-profit purposes and is not intended for secondary distribution or distribution,  
and there is no intention of infringing on the rights of the original creator.

# Requirement



* OS:Windows 11
* Visual studio

# Installation

(1) Select "Desktop Development with C++" to install and start Visual Studio.  
(2)Create a new project, and after selecting "Windows Desktop Wizard", create a folder in any location and select "Desktop Application" and "Empty Project".  
(3)Place Report.cpp in the header file and def.h and mlib.h in the source file.  
(4)Click "Local Windows Debugger" to start the game. When you exit, click the stop button on the right side of "Local Windows Debugger" instead of the x button on the tab.  

# Usage

■ Operation 
[Click <ネクスト> button]: Display new ball  
[A]: Move ball left  
[D]: Move ball right  
[S]: Drop ball  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
■ How to play the game  
Press <ネクスト> button to display the ball.  
The newly displayed balls are randomly selected from the three smallest (pink, light blue, yellow).  
The ball is moved to the left or right and dropped at the desired position.  
When balls of different colors collide, they reflect. When balls of the same color collide,  
the two balls disappear and a larger ball is created, and the score is added.  
When the <next> button is pressed again, another ball is displayed.  
The game is over and the game is reset when either ball hits the red dead line at the top of the screen after falling.

# Note
Q.The ball dips and makes unintended movements.  
A. We plan to fix this in a future update (timing to be determined),  
but we hope you will enjoy the game with a warm eye,  
as the irregular movement of the ball and the happening nature of the game can be considered attractive.
